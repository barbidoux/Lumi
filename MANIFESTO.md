# MANIFESTO

## Why this project exists

This project is not an attempt to recreate GPT-4 or break benchmarks.
It is a personal playground: learning by building, documenting every step, and sharing the process to demystify how an LLM can be trained from scratch.
I am not chasing a career or fame — I want every second of my life to be spent on something that excites me.

## How it was built

I used AI to create and to learn AI.
Nova, Lumi, and Rodin — three assistants I orchestrated in synergy — helped me design the components, structure the pipeline, and reflect on technical choices.
This is intentional: the point is not to prove I am “smarter than a machine,” but to work *with* AI as a research companion.

## Philosophy

I don’t have an excavator, I have a fork.
My resources are limited: one laptop, a 16 GB RTX 4090, and a few hours each day.
But technical complexity has never been an obstacle, only an exciting puzzle.
I would rather dig happily with a fork than wait for someone to hand me a bulldozer.

## Goal for others

This project is meant as a learning kit.
Everything is documented so others can reproduce, understand, and play.
The goal is to show that training a language model from scratch — pretrain, align, and serve — is possible with a bit of patience and perseverence even without supercomputers.
It is not production software. It is a living manual, a lab notebook, and an open sandbox.

## Limits & safeguards

* Models produced here are not reliable for sensitive use.
* Datasets are public, filtered, and cleaned for educational purposes.
* This project does not claim to solve truthfulness, bias, or advanced safety.
* Basic refusal rules are included to avoid obvious misuse.
